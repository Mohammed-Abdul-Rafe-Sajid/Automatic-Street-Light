# 🌃 Automatic Street Light Project

This project simulates an **Automatic Street Light** system using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) in **Tinkercad**. The system is designed to automatically turn **ON** streetlights when the surrounding light level is **low** (nighttime) and turn them **OFF** when the ambient light level is **high** (daytime).

## 🚦 Features

- **Sensor-based automation** using an LDR.
- Streetlight turns **ON** automatically in the dark.
- Streetlight turns **OFF** automatically when there's enough sunlight.
- Eco-friendly and energy-saving concept.
- Simulated entirely on **Tinkercad**, no physical hardware required.

## 🧠 Working Principle

An **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** is used to detect the light intensity:
- When **light intensity is high** (day), the resistance of LDR decreases, and the streetlight turns **OFF**.
- When **light intensity is low** (night), the resistance of LDR increases, and the streetlight turns **ON**.

This setup mimics real-world streetlight systems that save energy by avoiding manual operation.

## 🛠️ Components Used

- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- Arduino Uno
- LED (represents streetlight)
- Resistors
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires

## 🧾 How to Use

1. Open the Tinkercad simulation link (if available).
2. Click **Start Simulation**.
3. Adjust the ambient light using the **LDR light slider**.
4. Observe the LED automatically turning ON or OFF based on light levels.
